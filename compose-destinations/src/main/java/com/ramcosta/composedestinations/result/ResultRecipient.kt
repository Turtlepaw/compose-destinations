 * Recipient where you can install a listener to be notified of results (of type [R])
 * from a specific [DestinationSpec] (of type [D]).
 *
 * If declared as a parameter of a `@Destination` annotated Composable,
 * Compose Destinations will provide a correct implementation.
 *
 * If you're manually calling that Composable, then you can use
 * [com.ramcosta.composedestinations.scope.resultRecipient]
 * extension function to get a correctly typed implementation.
 * To get a correctly typed [com.ramcosta.composedestinations.navargs.DestinationsNavType]
 * in this case, check what the generated Destination object uses.
 *
 * Type safety related limitations (compile time enforced):
 * - [R] must be a valid navigation argument type.
 * - Each annotated Composable can have at most one parameter of type [ResultRecipient] for a given [DestinationSpec] ([D])
 * - [D] destination Composable must have a corresponding [ResultBackNavigator] of the same type [R]
